## Quick Notes from the course:

### Contracts
Solidity's code is encapsulated in contracts. A contract is the fundamental building block of Ethereum applications â€” all variables and functions belong to a contract, and this will be the starting point of all your projects.
An empty contract named HelloWorld would look like this:
```
contract HelloWorld {

}
```
